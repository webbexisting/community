            <p>The world won't be saved by one person. You're not big enough, not godly enough. You're just one figure in a infinitely huge universe, you're human and, just like everyone else, you're incapable of making any significant impact on the world in your lifetime. </p>
            <p>But is that a bad thing?</p>
            <p>If you're tired of looking at your life, this great complicated puzzle, and being told you should be able to solve it on your own then this is the place for you.</p>
            <p>We can't promise an individual solution to capitalism, but that isn't our goal either. Explore our work and learn how to find community, work outside a capitalist frame and change the world, one tiny, human step at a time. </p>
