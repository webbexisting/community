    <section id="aboutUs">
    <p>we're a group of disorganised people, trying to teach people the importance of community, of love. we believe, as others before us have said, that the most radical activism you can commit to is <i>caring for those around you.</i></p>
    <p>this isn't to say we don't advocate for other forms of activisim: everyone wants a better world, don't they? here, you'll find links to peaceful marches, civil disobedience gatherings, and classes on the history of resistance (<i>including </i>the violent kind).</p>
    <p>above all else, though, our goal remains this: to foster a future generation of people that are kind, educated, and unafraid to change the world by first changing their communitites.</p>
    <p>start that whatsapp group with your neighbours, and ask them for eggs sometimes. help a friend when they're acting out of character, no questions asked. annoy a politican (call their office, walk up to their expensice dinners, harrass them on the train) and don't feel scared of the consequences.</p>
    <p>our systems weren't built for people who radically <i> care</i>, so dismantle them by starting a revolution in your own home.</p>
